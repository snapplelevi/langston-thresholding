\title{get_iter_t_vals()
                         
User wrapper function for the intenal \code{get_iterative_t_values()}}
\usage{
get_iter_t_vals(outfile_prefix, recursive = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{outfile_prefix}{Prefix of output file, which can have several
output file paths if the same prefix is run with \code{analysis()} several times. 

Ex.) \code{get_iter_t_vals("iter-prefix")} will execute \code{get_iterative_t_values}
on all files names \code{iter-prefix-###.iterative.txt}, where \code{###} is the unique combination
of methods passed to \code{analysis()}. This value can be equal to nothing ("") if no
methods were passed to \code{analysis()}.}

\item{recursive}{Option to allow for subdirectory searching of the file prefix.
Set to FALSE for default in case of large subdirectories. This option is meant to help 
save time with R Studio and other editors' auto completion feature, which allows for tabbing
to complete the file name from the present working directory (PWD) and maintaining the current
PWD. 

If \code{FALSE}, \code{get_iter_t_vals()} will use the path passed to the function from outfile_prefix.
This may be either relative or absolute. Only the directory containing the desired file(s)
will be searched. (Note: if no file paths are explicitly provided, the PWD (".") will be used.)

If \code{TRUE}, \code{get_iter_t_vals()} will recursively searching through all files matching the Regex pattern
of \code{^output_prefix.*\\.iterative\\.txt$}, which essentially allows for any file name that starts 
with the specified outfile_prefix and ends with ".iterative.txt".}
}
\value{
A list containing both a dataframe and a list. The dataframe contains the raw interative
thresholding data at each threshold value for the requested methods. The nested list contains
each requested method (for the particular analysis output file(s) found from the output prefix)
and its corresponding threshold value.
}
\description{
Returns the thresholding data frame created by the internal
get_iterative_t_values, which does not return anything to the user. This
data frame contains step-by-step thresholding figures for analysis methods, 
edge counts, vertex counts, and other metrics computed as a result of the 
\code{analysis()} function.
