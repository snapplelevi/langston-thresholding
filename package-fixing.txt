WARNINGS

1. **(SOLVED)** Cast pointer to int warning in igraph file 
    --------- SOLVED  ----------
    used preprocessing if macros to determine whether to use C++ or C
    style casting (#ifdef __cplusplus --> then use C++ style casting)


2. CRLF endings from Makefiles produced from Cmake. (can we even
    do anything about this? Could just specify in the email to CRAN
    what the deal is)
    
    Try old $(MAKE) command with igraph-0.8.0? 
        This leads to the old classic "byte" conflict on windows between
        the <windows.h> and  "rpcndr.h" headers. 
        
        Could this be undeffed somehow? look more into this

    
3. **(SOLVED)**GNU extensions in Makefiles produced by Cmake

  set_target_properties (?)

  Try old $(MAKE) command with igraph-0.8.0?
  
    This leads to the old classic "byte" conflict on windows between
          the <windows.h> and  "rpcndr.h" headers. 
          
          Could this be undeffed somehow? look more into this
  
  Ended up adding "SystemRequirements: GNU make" into the DESCRIPTION
  file. This decreases portability, but may be able to make our case with 
  the CRAN team. Other ways to fix this 
  
4. **(SOLVED)** rand(), and abort() warnings in src/ap.cpp (part of alglib) 

  Rcpp::stop() to replace abort() and end program execution 
    Can replace to another function later if signal passing is truly needed
  
  rand() will be replaced by R::runif(0, RAND_MAX)
  to get a uniformly distributed pseudorandom number from [0, RAND_MAX]
  where RAND_MAX is still defined in stdlib.h
  
  
  

5. **(SOLVED)** checking PDF version of manual ... WARNING

  STILL NEED TO TEST WITH TINYTEX OPTION
   LaTeX errors when creating PDF version.
   This typically indicates Rd problems.
   
   Installed MiKTeX locally through MiKTeX installer, did not notice the 
   option to use "tinytex" when creating PDF
   
   Is there a way to install MiKTeX for R through install.packages()? or importing?
   That way it could be included in the DESCRIPTION file
   
   options in Tools -> Global Options -> Sweave -> use Tinytex
   
   Add MiKTeX to SystemRequirements? Import tinytex? need to see
   
   
   
   
ERRORS
1. ** (SOLVED) ** checking PDF version of manual without index ... ERROR
     
     Re-running with no redirection of stdout/stderr.
     
     Is this coupled with the PDF warning? - YES IT WAS!!
     
     Fixed after installing MiKTeX, but have not tried it with TinyTex.
     hoping that Tinytex would work since that is a much simpler option
