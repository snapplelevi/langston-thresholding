WARNINGS

1. (SOLVED) Cast pointer to int warning in igraph file

2. CRLF endings from Makefiles produced from Cmake. (can we even
    do anything about this? Could just specify in the email to CRAN
    what the deal is)
    
3. GNU extensions in Makefiles produced by Cmake
  set_target_properties (?)
