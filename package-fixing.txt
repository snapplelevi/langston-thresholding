WARNINGS

1. **(SOLVED)** Cast pointer to int warning in igraph file 
    --------- SOLVED  ----------
    used preprocessing if macros to determine whether to use C++ or C
    style casting (#ifdef __cplusplus --> then use C++ style casting)

2. CRLF endings from Makefiles produced from Cmake. (can we even
    do anything about this? Could just specify in the email to CRAN
    what the deal is)
    
    Try old $(MAKE) command with igraph-0.8.0? 
        This leads to the old classic "byte" conflict on windows between
        the <windows.h> and  "rpcndr.h" headers. 
        
        Could this be undeffed somehow? look more into this
    
3. GNU extensions in Makefiles produced by Cmake

4. **(SOLVED)** rand(), and abort() warnings in src/ap.cpp (part of alglib) 

  Rcpp::stop() to replace abort() and end program execution 
    Can replace to another function later if signal passing is truly needed
  
  rand() will be replaced by R::runif(0, RAND_MAX)
  to get a uniformly distributed pseudorandom number from [0, RAND_MAX]
  where RAND_MAX is still defined in stdlib.h

   This typically indicates Rd problems.
