Description: An R wrapper of C++ code that encapsulates several graph thresholding utilities and analysis tools. 
    Thresholding a graph helps to iteratively remove lower significance edges from a graph, and potentially shrinking the graph by pruning off disconnected vertices. 
    These methods readily apply to biological data, Pearson and Spearman correlations, and other types of graph data. 
    Our analysis tools take in a graph input file, and the user specifies what operations to perform on the graph to help determine the optimal threshold for the graph. 
    These thresholding tools rely on the 'igraph' C library for graph creation and manipulation. Other functionalities are used from the 'alglib' mathematical library. 
    After thresholding analysis through 'analysis()' is completed, a user can plot their results, extract the results from respective thresholding methods using 'get_results()', 
    or the data frames produced from a specified method (iterative, local global, and significance values).
