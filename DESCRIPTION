Description: An R wrapper of C++ code that encapsulates several graph thresholding utilities and analysis tools. 
    Thresholding a graph helps to iteratively remove lower significance edges from a graph, and potentially shrinking the graph by pruning off disconnected vertices. 
    These methods readily apply to biological data, Pearson/Spearman correlations, and other types of graph   . 
    Our analysis tools take in a graph input file, and the user specifies what operations to perform on the graph to help determine the optimal threshold for the graph. 
    These thresholding tools rely on the igraph C library for graph creation and manipulation. Other functionalities are used from the alglib mathematical library as well. 
    After thresholding analysis is completed, a user can plot their results, extract the results from respective thresholding methods using get_results(), or the data frames produced from a specified method (iterative, local global, and significance values).
