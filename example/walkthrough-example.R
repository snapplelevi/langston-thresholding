# file name prefixes for future reference 
# it_suffix <- ".iterative.txt"
# stat_suffix <- ".statistical_errors.txt"
# local_global <- ".local_global.txt"

# Installing the package (for development)
# install.packages("../thresholding_1.0.0.tar.gz", type='source', repos=NULL)

# Load and attach the thresholding namespace 
library(thresholding)

# Relative path to .ncol data file
data_file <- system.file("extdata", "HumanCellCycleSubset.ncol", package="thresholding")
data_prefix <- './HumanCellCycleSubset'   # prefix used in other functions in package


#          Step 1 - make edge weight histogram of data
# First we can take a look at the edge weight distribution
# Use '?thresholding::edge_hist' in R terminal for more documentation
bin_width <- 0.01
edge_hist(data_file, bin_width = bin_width)


#          Step 2 - running analysis on the graph
# Now let's do the analysis of our graph. 
# To make it time efficient, lets do percolation, significance and power, and scale-free methods. 
# By default it will also calculate density at each threshold. 
# We'll start at a lower threshold limit of 0.6, and leave the increment at the default of 0.01. 
# Remember to give the number of samples using -n.
# 
# Method integers given for reference here:
#       1 - all
#       2 - significance and power calculations (only valid for Pearson CC)
#       3 - scale free
#       4 - maximal cliques
#       5 - spectral methods
#       6 - random matrix theory
#       7 - clustering coefficient
#       8 - percolation
#       Use '?anaylsis' for more documentation

# NOTE: num_samples, or number of samples, is NEEDED for doing method 2 (significance and power 
# calculations). Supplying num_samples <= 4  when using method 2 will cause the analysis()
# function to end execution. Not supplying the proper number of samples will lead to incorrect analysis()
# results. There were 13 samples used in the data file given from Carissa's example data file
# (HumanCellCycleSubset.ncol)
methods <- c(8, 2, 3)    # select the three desired analysis methods
starting_thresh <- 0.6   # choose lower bound thresholding value the thresholding loop begins at
num_samples <- 13

#          Step 3 - Get analysis results
# Use get_results to see the output of the thresholding analysis across different runs
# of the same data file
# Data prefix is the same prefix used as the parameter to analysis which was 
#   A.) user provided
#   B.) automatically generated by analysis function
#       in which case, use the prefix given from the standard output in the R terminal
#       for the proper prefix to use

# and only save those to D for output (no NaN'ers for things not used)
print(get_results_out$density_min)
print(get_res_D$whole_graph)

#         Step 4a/b - Observe graph method thresholds and threshold graph
# Testing the plot functionalites
# can also do this to just display the plot instead of return it
